# flask-careers-site

This is site is similar version of the one developed in the youtube video from freecodecamp - [Web Development with Python Tutorial â€“ Flask & Dynamic Database-Driven Web Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBDHkveJUf4)

Instead of the Bootstrap theme used in the video, this one uses Tailwind CSS framework for styling the website.

Will update more about it soon after covering the future steps mentioned in the video..
